__Optimisation Code__

This includes all of the optimisation files created over several generations. Most is legacy code.

Compton Optimisation is a re-write of the Compton Master notebook for the fixed bandwidth optimisation technique.
It is re-wrote to be more conducive to Mathematica's style. It runs quicker and is capable of doing more precise optimisations.

Compton Master is still functional code. It contains an optimisation to show the possible adjustment for small changes in energy spread.
