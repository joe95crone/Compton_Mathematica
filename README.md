# Compton_Mathematica
Mathematica notebooks from Compton Work.

All of **my** Mathematica scripts for Compton calculations and Optimizations.

Other Compton Mathematica scripts such as those by Val Kostroun are elsewhere.

__Change Log__

The FixedBandwidthOptExtended.nb works for the CBETA case and produces plots for CBETA that drop off at the expected minimum tunable bandwidth. 

The ComptonMaster.nb now works and is operable for the none head-on case and for energy spread optimisation.
